What to practice:
1. Iteration & Recursion
2. Arrays & Matricies
3. Linked Lists
4. Queues, Stacks, Heaps
5. Sets & HashMaps
6. Trees & Binary Search
7. Graphs, BFS, DFS
8. Tries
9. Sorting
10. Dynamic Programming, Memoization, Divide & Conquer, Bottom-Up
11. Proofs
12. Multiple Pointers
13. Sliding Windows
14. Greedy Algorithms


How to practice effictively:
1. Identify Key Lessons/Takeaways from a problem/solution
2. After completing a questions, write down the one or two things you could have done or known that would have made the problem easier.
3. Are those lessons useful in an interview?


Where to find good study material:
1. LeetCode
2. Berkely - CS 61A,B
3. Harvey  - CS50 
4. CMU
5. Datastructures sections on HackerRank & GeeksForGeeks
6. Gayle's Datastructure Videos

How to start after the question:
0. Do not write code until you know how to solve the problem!
1. Draw picture of the problem as it's being described
2. Add the inputs and the outputs to the drawing
3. Walk/talk through how to convert an input->output
4. Codify step #3 into an algorithm & handle edge cases.

Discuss solution with interviewer to confirm approach:
1. Explain solution in plain english
2. Step-by-step (bullets)
3. Pseudo-code
4. Functions
5. Implementation

Ask questions in interview that help move toward solution:
1. What is my Big-O
2. What is the next best Big-O
3. Why is this possible
4. Where is the repeated work happening?
5. Does this need to happen?
6. Why is this hard to code? (do I need a temp variable?)
