/**
 * Problem #:  0015
 * Name:       3Sum
 * Tags:       Array
 * Difficulty: Medium
 * Techniques: Two-Pointer, Sliding Window
 *
 * Given an array nums of n integers, are there elements a, b, c in nums such that a + b + c = 0?
 * Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.
 *
 * Note:
 *
 * The solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * Given array nums = [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4],
 *
 * A solution set is:
 * [
 *   [-1, 0, 1],
 *   [-1, -1, 2]
 * ]
 *
 * Learnings:
 * 1) We can optimize for O(1) instead of O(N) space by first running an in-place sort in O(n log n) time.
 * 2) Read the instructions carefully - the problem asks for *all* solutions.  This must cover all 2sums!
